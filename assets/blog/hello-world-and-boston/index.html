<p>As I write this, I am sitting on an airplane bound for Boston, where I will (co-)run <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/nexthunt.html">MIT Mystery Hunt 2k19</a> (a puzzle hunt). For now, the contents of the Hunt are super-secret. Once the puzzles are publicly available (estimate a week), I will post here the puzzles that I wrote. There are between three and seven such puzzles, depending how you count.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar with Mystery Hunt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8dqmk4YCQk">here</a> is a great 52-minute documentary on the topic, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ly_-IIFCQ">here</a> is a great 12-minute TED talk. Each of the two provides a great overview of the event. Or do what I do, which is to learn exclusively from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Mystery_Hunt">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>So from now until the end of the long weekend, Iâ€™ll be working 14-hour days to enable a bunch of nerds to become frustrated. Stay tuned for the ensuing delirium. ðŸŒ </p>
