<h3>Work</h3>
<ul>
	<li>At Google, officially in Boulder but really in quarantine.</li>
	<li>Working on the ChromeOS Engineering Productivity team.</li>
	<li>I'm migrating firmware testing libraries from gnarly old <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/autotest/+/master/">Autotest</a> to sleek new <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/+/HEAD/README.md">Tast</a>. It's faster, stabler, and maintainabler.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Home</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jill and I recently got a puppydog. Her name is Omelet and she's beautiful. She's also a handful. We're all learning.</li>
	<li>My meditation practice is all fouled up. This is an emergent property of having a new puppydog.</li>
	<li>After watching <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/"><i>The Social Dilemma</i></a>, I deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts, and started avoiding attention-hungry tech.</li>
	<li>I learned how to use Google Cloud Platform and Google App Engine! Cloud hosting has been a gap in my skillset for a long time, so this is a win.</li>
</ul>
