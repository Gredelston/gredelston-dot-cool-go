For the past 18 months, I have practiced the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology, with Evernote as the de-facto home for my Next Action lists. I briefly experimented with a paper system, but I found that the portability of a digital system makes a big difference for me.

In the name of iteration, today I am switching from Evernote to Todoist. Hereâ€™s why.

1. Todoist is built for to-do lists, whereas Evernote is a general notetaking platform. Todoist thus comes with productivity-specific workflows, like planning daily tasks or setting priorities, which Evernote does not.
1. Evernoteâ€™s web interface is clunky. I fell in love with Evernote on Windows and Android. However, from 9-5 I use OSâ€™s which require me to use the web interface. It takes five clicks to select a note and move it to a different notebook, which makes processing my Inbox feel cumbersome. In contrast, Todoistâ€™s web interface is filled with lovely shortcuts.

Thatâ€™s it! I only have two reasons. Mostly itâ€™s the second one.

Iâ€™m not yet deprecating my Evernote folders, but if I still like Todoist after a month, then Iâ€™ll make it a hard cutover. Evernote will remain my repository for actual notes, like recipes and friendsâ€™ birthdays.
